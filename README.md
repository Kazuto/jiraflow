# JiraFlow

A CLI tool that creates GitFlow-compliant git branches from Jira ticket information. Simplify your workflow by automatically generating properly formatted branch names from ticket numbers and titles.

## Features

- üéØ Automatically format Jira ticket information into git branch names
- üîó Fetch ticket titles using Jira CLI (optional)
- üåä GitFlow support (feature, hotfix, refactor, support branches)
- üîß Configurable via YAML with automatic default config creation
- ‚ö° Fast and lightweight Go implementation
- üßπ Smart sanitization of branch names (removes special characters, truncates length)
- üé® Beautiful interactive TUI using Charm Bracelet libraries
- üîÄ Interactive branch selection - choose any local branch as base
- üîç Searchable branch list with fuzzy matching

## Prerequisites

- **Git** - for branch creation
- **[Jira CLI](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli)** (optional) - required only if you want to automatically fetch ticket titles from Jira

### Installing Jira CLI (Optional)

JiraFlow can automatically fetch ticket titles from Jira using the [Jira CLI](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli). This is optional - you can always enter titles manually.

#### Install Jira CLI
```bash
# macOS
brew install ankitpokhrel/jira-cli/jira-cli

# Linux/Windows - see https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli#installation
```

#### Configure Jira CLI
```bash
jira init
```

This will prompt you for:
- Jira server URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`)
- Email address
- API token (create at: Account Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí API tokens)

Once configured, JiraFlow will automatically fetch ticket titles when you provide just the ticket number.

jiraflow --dry-run --type feature --ticket TEST-123 --title "Test installation"
```

## Configuration

JiraFlow automatically creates a configuration file at `~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml` on first run with sensible defaults. No manual setup required!

### Automatic Configuration

When you run JiraFlow for the first time, it will:
1. Create the `~/.config/jiraflow/` directory
2. Generate a default configuration file
3. Use the configuration immediately

### Manual Configuration (Optional)

You can customize the configuration by editing the file:

```bash
# Edit configuration
nano ~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml

# Or use your preferred editor
code ~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml
```

### Configuration Options

See [`jiraflow.example.yaml`](jiraflow.example.yaml) for a complete configuration example with all available options and documentation.

#### Key Settings

```yaml
# Maximum branch name length (10-200, default: 60)
max_branch_length: 60

# Default branch type for non-interactive mode (default: feature)
default_branch_type: feature

# Branch type prefixes - customize to match your team's conventions
branch_types:
  feature: "feature/"     # New features and enhancements
  hotfix: "hotfix/"       # Critical bug fixes for production
  refactor: "refactor/"   # Code improvements without changing functionality
  support: "support/"     # Maintenance and support tasks

# Branch name sanitization
sanitization:
  separator: "-"          # Replace spaces/special chars (default: -)
  lowercase: true         # Convert to lowercase (default: true)
  remove_umlauts: false   # Remove German umlauts √§√∂√º√Ñ√ñ√ú√ü (default: false)
```

#### Custom Configuration Examples

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp jiraflow.example.yaml ~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml

# Edit with your preferences
nano ~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
jiraflow [branch-type] [ticket-number] [ticket-title (optional)]
```

If no ticket title is provided, JiraFlow will automatically fetch the title from Jira using the Jira CLI (`jira issue view --raw` command).

### Examples

**Create a feature branch with explicit title:**
```bash
jiraflow feature PROJ-123 "Add user profile dashboard"
```
Output: `feature/PROJ-123-Add-user-profile-dashboard`

**Create a feature branch (fetch title using Jira CLI):**
```bash
jiraflow feature PROJ-123
```
Output: `feature/PROJ-123-Add-user-profile-dashboard`
(Title fetched automatically via `jira issue view PROJ-123 --raw`)

**Create a hotfix branch:**
```bash
jiraflow hotfix PROJ-456
```
Output: `hotfix/PROJ-456-Fix-critical-payment-gateway-timeout`

**Create a refactor branch with explicit title:**
```bash
jiraflow refactor PROJ-789 "Restructure pricing calculation logic"
```
Output: `refactor/PROJ-789-Restructure-pricing-calculation-logic`

**Create a support branch:**
```bash
jiraflow support PROJ-321
```
Output: `support/PROJ-321-Add-legacy-API-compatibility-layer`

**Using default branch type (feature):**
```bash
jiraflow PROJ-555
```
Output: `feature/PROJ-555-Implement-new-authentication-flow`

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

Run jiraflow without arguments to launch the beautiful interactive TUI:

```bash
jiraflow
```

#### Interactive Workflow

The TUI guides you through a 4-step process:

1. **üéØ Branch Type Selection**
   - Choose from: feature, hotfix, refactor, support
   - Navigate with arrow keys, select with Enter

2. **üåø Base Branch Selection**
   - See all your local Git branches
   - Real-time search with `/` key
   - Fuzzy matching to find branches quickly

3. **üé´ Ticket Information**
   - Enter Jira ticket number (e.g., PROJ-123)
   - Optionally enter title or auto-fetch from Jira
   - Tab between fields, Enter to continue

4. **‚úÖ Confirmation & Creation**
   - Preview the final branch name
   - Confirm to create and checkout the branch
   - See success confirmation

#### TUI Features

- üé® **Beautiful Interface** - Built with Charm Bracelet libraries
- üîç **Smart Search** - Fuzzy matching for branch names
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Navigation** - Intuitive shortcuts (‚Üë/‚Üì, Enter, Esc, /)
- üîô **Step Navigation** - Go back/forward through steps
- üéØ **Real-time Preview** - See branch name as you type
- üö® **Error Handling** - Clear error messages and recovery options
- üé≠ **Graceful Degradation** - Works even if Jira CLI is unavailable

### TUI Controls

When using the interactive mode, use these keyboard shortcuts:

- **‚Üë/‚Üì** - Navigate through options
- **Enter** - Select current option or proceed to next step
- **Esc** - Go back to previous step
- **/** - Search/filter (in branch selection)
- **q** or **Ctrl+C** - Quit the application

### Checkout After Creation

The tool automatically creates and checks out the new branch. To only print the branch name without creating it:

```bash
jiraflow --dry-run feature PROJ-123
```

Or with an explicit title:

```bash
jiraflow --dry-run feature PROJ-123 "Add user profile dashboard"
```

## GitFlow Branch Types

- **feature/** - New features and enhancements
- **hotfix/** - Critical bug fixes for production
- **refactor/** - Code improvements without changing functionality
- **support/** - Maintenance and support tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not a Git repository"
```bash
# Ensure you're in a Git repository
git status

# Initialize if needed
git init
```

#### "Jira CLI not found" or "Failed to fetch title"
This is normal if Jira CLI isn't installed or configured. JiraFlow will:
- Allow manual title entry
- Continue working without Jira integration
- Show helpful error messages

#### "Branch already exists"
```bash
# List existing branches
git branch

# Delete existing branch if needed
git branch -D feature/PROJ-123-existing-branch

# Or use a different ticket number/title
```

#### Configuration Issues
```bash
# Reset to defaults
rm ~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml
jiraflow  # Will recreate with defaults

# Check configuration
cat ~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Ensure proper permissions for config directory
chmod 755 ~/.config/jiraflow/
chmod 644 ~/.config/jiraflow/jiraflow.yaml
```
