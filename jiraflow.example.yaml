# Default branch type when not specified in non-interactive mode
# Must be one of the keys defined in branch_types below

# Branch type prefixes - customize these to match your team's conventions
branch_types:
  feature: "feature/"     # New features and enhancements
  hotfix: "hotfix/"       # Critical bug fixes for production
  refactor: "refactor/"   # Code improvements without changing functionality
  support: "support/"     # Maintenance and support tasks

# Branch name sanitization settings
sanitization:
  # Character used to replace spaces and special characters

#
# For teams with international characters:
